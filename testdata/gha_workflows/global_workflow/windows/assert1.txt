Ritchie is a platform that helps you and your team to save time by
giving you the power to create powerful templates to execute important
tasks across your team and organization with minimum time and with standards,
delivering autonomy to developers with security.

You can keep the configuration without adding the community repository,
but you will need to provide a git repo with the formulas templates and add them with
"rit add repo" command, naming this repository obligatorily as "commons".

See how to do this on the example:
[https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-formulas/blob/master/templates/create_formula/README.md]

Run "rit add repo" to add a new repository manually.
